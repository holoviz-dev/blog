    "## What is Datashader?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Datashader](https://datashader.org) is an open-source Python library for rendering large datasets quickly and accurately. Datashader provides highly optimized, scalable support for rasterizing your data into a fixed-size array for pixel-based displays, while avoiding overplotting and other issues that make it difficult to work with large datasets. Datashader works well on its own, but it is even more powerful when embedded into an interactive plotting library like Bokeh, Plotly, or (now!) Matplotlib.\n",

    "One of Datashader's most powerful features is its categorical binning and categorical colormapping, which allow detailed understanding of how the distribution of data differs by some other variable, such as this plot of how population is segregated by race in New York City:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://datashader.org/assets/images/nyc_races.jpg\" width=\"60%\"></img>\n",

    "To build such a plot, Datashader calculates a stack of aggregate arrays simulaneously, one per category, instead of a single aggregate array as in the non-categorical case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, categorical binning and plotting was limited to a `count()` reduction, i.e., counting how many datapoints fell into each pixel, by category, implemented using a special `cat_count()` reduction. Categorical plotting has now been fully generalized into a new `ds.by()` reduction, which accepts a categorical column along with `count()` or\n",
    "any other reduction (`max()`, `min()`, `mean()`, `sum()`, etc.). Thus it's now possible to plot the mean value of any column, per pixel, per category.\n",
    "See the [Pipeline docs](https://datashader.org/getting_started/Pipeline.html) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also now use categorical binning and plotting with numerical columns using new functions `category_modulo` and `category_binning`, which opens up entirely new applications for Datashader. `category_binning` effectively gives Datashader the power to do 3D aggregations of numeric axes, not just the usual 2D.  For instance, `by(category_binning('z', 0, 10, 16))` will bin by the floating-point column `z`, counting datapoints in each of 16 categories (0: 0<=z<10, 1: 10<=x<20, etc.). Combining `category_binning` with `by`, you can now do complex 3D binning like computing the maximum age in each (x, y, weight) range:\n",

    "Datashader's points plotting is designed to aggregate datapoints by pixel, accurately counting how many datapoints fell into each pixel. For large datasets, such a plot will accuratelyl reveal the spatial distribution of the data over the axes plotted. However, a consequence is that an individual data point not surrounded by others will show up as a single pixel, which can be difficult to see on a high-resolution monitor, and it is almost impossible to see its color. To alleviate this issue and make it easier to go back and forth between the big picture and individual datapoints, Datashader has long offered the `dynspread` output-transformation function, which takes each pixel and dilates it (increases it in size) until the density of such points reaches a specified metric value. However, dynspread never worked very well in practice, always either doing no spreading or one step of spreading (a 3x3 kernel). After a fresh look at the code, it became clear that the first step of spreading was artificially increasing the amount of estimated pixel density, making it very unlikely that a second or third step would ever be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "dynspread now spreads each pixel by an integer radius `px` up to the maximum radius `max_px`, stopping earlier if a specified fraction of data points have non-empty neighbors within the radius. This new definition provides predictable, well-behave dynspread behavior even for large values of max_px, making isolated datapoints easily visible.

    "\n",
    "Note that this definition is only compatible with points, as they are spatially isolated; any usage of dynspread with datatypes other than points should be replaced with spread(), which will do what was probably intended by the original dynspread call anyway (i.e., to make a line or polygon edge thicker)."

E.g. in holoviews, use `spread(rasterize(obj)).opts(cnorm='eq_hist', cmap='fire')` (or `cnorm='log'`) instead of `datashade(obj, cmap='fire')`, and you'll now have colorbar and hover support using Bokeh 2.3.3 or later.
