    "**What is Panel?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel is an open-source library that lets you create custom interactive web apps and dashboards by connecting widgets to plots, images, tables, and text - all while writing only Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel integrates seamlessly with your existing work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Your code:** Step into Panel with your existing work :) Continue to use the PyData ecosystem that you already know and love: matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot, bokeh, plotly, altair, echarts, holoviews, dask, datashader, and more! \n",
    "- **Your workflows:** Move the same code freely between a Jupyter Notebook (or other interactive prompt), your IDE, and standalone apps running in the browser or on a server. Easily switch between exploring your data, building visualizations, adding custom interactivity, sharing with non-technical users, and back again at any point, using the same tools and code throughout.\n",

    "**New release!**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are very pleased to announce the 0.14 release of Panel! This release focuses on three main themes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Support for running Panel entirely in the browser using WebAssembly (via Pyodide and PyScript)\n",
    "2. Quality of life improvements to make it easier to build responsive and performant applications\n",
    "3. Improvements to static typing and docstrings to enhance the developer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now easily:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **run your apps and documentation in in the browser. No server required!**\n",
    "- provide error messages to your users via a **global exception handler**.\n",
    "- **display large tables** with a much more robust Tabulator widget.\n",
    "- build **data apps that load faster** because \n",
    "  - we now provide the easy to use `pn.cache` decorator.  \n",
    "  - we now have our own CDN (https://cdn.holoviz.org/) to serve assets to your data app fast.\n",
    "- find the information you need via **improved documentation**, docstring and type annotations.\n",
    "- preview your apps inside Jupyter using **custom Jupyter kernels**.\n",

    "## Run Panel apps entirely in your browser\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel lets you write dashboards and other applications in Python that are accessed using a web browser. You typically have to deploy your Panel app to a web server. This introduces some pains\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deployment of a web server is a separate skill that takes time and is costly\n",
    "- The communication between the server and browser introduces latency, it takes time to communicate back and forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel 0.14 flips that on its head. It is now possible to run a large set of Panel Apps directly in the browser, with **no separate server needed and super-fast response times!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying technology involved is called [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (or WASM). More specifically, [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) pioneered the ability to install Python libraries, manipulate the web page's [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) from Python, and execute regular Python code entirely in the browser. A number of libraries have sprung up around Python in WASM, including [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways you can run Panel apps in your browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatically converting Panel applications into a Pyodide/PyScript based application\n",

    "In order to better demonstrate the interactive features of Panel in our documentation we decided to write a **Sphinx extension** that would turn static embedded content into live material that can be run entirely in your browser. When you visit certain pages in our documentation you will now see a `Play` button on the code cells. When you click it, it will warn you that executing the cells will download a Python runtime and once you confirm it will fetch Pyodide, all required libraries and finally render the output.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Use Panel in PyScript & Pyodide\n",
    "\n",
    "You can of course also easily leverage Panel by writing your own Pyodide and PyScript code. We have a detailed guide how to convert your own applications, leverage Panel from PyScript & Pyodide and how to use the Sphinx extension [in the Panel documentation](https://panel.holoviz.org/user_guide/Running_in_Webassembly.html). We also hope to split out the Sphinx extension into its own package in the near future."

    "## Simplified Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the very early days Panel has had a global cache in the form of the `pn.state.cache` dictionary (and the `pn.state.as_cached` helper function), which allows you to cache data and other objects across sessions easily. This is a very simple approach but still requires some manual effort to set up, for that reason we have decided to include a new `pn.cache` decorator in this release which automatically [memoizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) a function, e.g. if we have a function to `load_data` given some path the `pn.cache` function will cache the output for the given path:"

In this release we have re-implemented a server that runs entirely within a Jupyter kernel and when previewing a notebook we will automatically default to the kernel selected in the notebook's metadata.

    "## Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous minor release we declared that it would be the last minor release before the Panel 1.0 release. Obviously that is not how things happened. Note that 1.0 will introduce major changes and we will be looking to you to provide feedback and help test the release. So look out for announcements of alpha, beta and release candidate releases and help make sure Panel 1.0 will be the success we hope it will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel 1.0 should make it really, really simple and fun to create performant data apps for Pythonistas across development and deployment environments. To achieve this, we want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finalize the core apis of Panel to make them simple and efficient to use\n",
    "- Heavily improve the documentation. We started by building the technical foundation. Now we are ready for the documentation.\n",
    "- Identify performance bottlenecks and remove them.\n",
    "- Upgrade to Bokeh 3.0 which will provide a much better foundation for styling, performance and Panel in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation & Website\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the 0.14 release we did a bunch of work to make the documentation more interactive and organize it a little better. However there is a ton of work to do and we are rolling out **[a user survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeBeLEkyYbyTX4P--k5qtbsN-c1rEr8lmFH_Kw22GWfeSL4RA/viewform?usp=sf_link)** to better understand where we are falling short (**Note**: This survey will close in early Nov 2022). We have also begun a more general effort to redesign our documentation leaning heavily on the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) to make our documentation more accessible and approachable. Look forward to a completely overhauled How-To guide and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Native applications\n",
    "\n",
    "With the [Beeware](https://beeware.org/) project continuing to make strides we now have a basic prototype for compiling Panel application for different platforms including iOS and Android!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rewrite of the layout engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel is built on top of Bokeh which was originally a plotting library but included an extremely powerful server architecture that has allowed us to build this entire ecosystem on top of. One of the legacies of Bokeh being primarily a plotting library was that it included a layout engine to ensure plots could be easily aligned. Unfortunately this also had severe downsides, specifically since this so called \"managed layout\" had to perform expensive computations to measure the size of different components on the page. This is why when you build complex nested layouts using rows, columns and grids you could sometimes slow down your application. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Bokeh 3.0 release is now fast approaching and we have begun upgrading Panel to support the new CSS based unmanaged layout, which will free us from the performance bottlenecks of the past. This will result in a bright new future for Panel but it may also be also be a little disruptive in the short term. As soon as development versions of Bokeh 3.0 and Panel 1.0 are available we would therefore appreciate if you could provide us with feedback about any regressions related to layouts in your own applications so we can minimize the upgrade path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSS & Styling\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major change resulting from the upgrade to Bokeh 3.0 will be in the way styling is managed. In the past you had the ability to modify styling of Panel/Bokeh components by constructing somewhat brittle CSS rules. This will now be a thing of the past as we will expose the stylesheets for all components directly in Python. This will afford much greater and simplified control over the styling of components but will also disrupt anyone who relied on applying CSS stylesheets directly. We again hope to minimize the disruptions related to this change and will provide a detailed migration guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Help us!\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel is an open-source project and we are always looking for new contributors. Join us the discussion on the [Discourse](https://discourse.holoviz.org/) and we would be very excited to get you started contributing! Also please [get in touch with us](mailto:prudiger@anaconda.com) if you work at an organization that would like to support future Panel development, fund new Panel features, or set up a support contract.\n",
