    "## Harnessing the Power of ML/AI\n",
    "\n",
    "ML/AI has become an integral part of data analysis and decision-making processes. With Panel, you can seamlessly integrate ML models and results into your visualizations. In this blog post, we will explore how to make an image classification task using the OpenAI CLIP model.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIP is pretrained on a large dataset of image-text pairs, enabling it to understand images and corresponding textual descriptions and work for various downstream tasks such as image classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ML-related functions we used to perform the image classification task. \n",
    "The first function `load_processor_model` enables us to load a pre-trained CLIP model from Hugging Face.\n",
    "The second function `get_similarity_score` calculates the degree of similarity between the image and a provided list of class labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@pn.cache\n",
    "def load_processor_model(\n",
    "    processor_name: str, model_name: str\n",
    ") -> Tuple[CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel]:\n",
    "    processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(processor_name)\n",
    "    model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(model_name)\n",
    "    return processor, model\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_similarity_scores(class_items: List[str], image: Image) -> List[float]:\n",
    "    processor, model = load_processor_model(\n",
    "        \"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\", \"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    inputs = processor(\n",
    "        text=class_items,\n",
    "        images=[image],\n",
    "        return_tensors=\"pt\",  # pytorch tensors\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    outputs = model(**inputs)\n",
    "    logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image\n",
    "    class_likelihoods = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1).detach().numpy()\n",
    "    return class_likelihoods[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binding Widgets for Interactivity\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key strengths of Panel is its ability to bind widgets to functions. This functionality provides an intuitive interface for users to manipulate the underlying data and gain deeper insights through interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we have a `process_input` function, which formats the similarity score we get from the image classification model to a Panel object with a good-looking UI. The actual function utilizes async; if you’re unfamiliar with async, don’t worry! We will explain it in a later section, but note async is **not** a requirement of using Panel--Panel simply supports it!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def process_inputs(class_names: List[str], image_url: str):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    High level function that takes in the user inputs and returns the\n",
    "    classification results as panel objects.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    yield results\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Panel Widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two widgets that we use to interact with this function. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `image_url` is a TextInput widget, which allows entering any string as the image URL. \n",
    "2. `class_names` is another TextInput widget, which accepts possible class names for the model to classify. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "image_url = pn.widgets.TextInput(\n",
    "    name=\"Image URL to classify\",\n",
    "    value=pn.bind(random_url, randomize_url),\n",
    ")\n",
    "class_names = pn.widgets.TextInput(\n",
    "    name=\"Comma separated class names\",\n",
    "    placeholder=\"Enter possible class names, e.g. cat, dog\",\n",
    "    value=\"cat, dog, parrot\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binding Widgets to Function\n",
    "Based on the  `process_inputs` function signature, it accepts two parameters: `class_names` and `image_url`. We can bind each arg/kwarg to a widget using `pn.bind` like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "interactive_result = pn.panel(\n",
    "    pn.bind(process_inputs, image_url=image_url, class_names=class_names),\n",
    "    height=600,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first positional argument is the function name.\n",
    "- The keyword arguments after match the function's signature, and thus the widgets' values are bound to the function's keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify, if the widget was named `image_url_input` instead of `image_url`, then the call would be: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "pn.bind(process_inputs, image_url=image_url_input, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding Template Design Styling\n",
    "\n",
    "The aesthetics of your applications and dashboards play a critical role in engaging your audience. Panel enables you to add styling based off popular designs like Material or Fast to your visualizations, allowing you to create visually appealing and professional-looking interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we used a `bootstrap` template, where we can control what we’d like to show in multiple areas such as `title` and `main`, and we can specify sizes and colors for various components:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pn.extension(design=\"bootstrap\", sizing_mode=\"stretch_width\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We also set the `Progress` bar design to `Material`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "row_bar = pn.indicators.Progress(\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    design=pn.theme.Material,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, you can use `styles` and `stylesheets` too!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caching for Expensive Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Some data processing tasks can be computationally expensive, causing sluggish performance. Panel offers caching mechanisms that allow you to store the results of expensive computations and reuse them when needed, significantly improving the responsiveness of your applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we cached the output of the `load_processor_model` using the `pn.cache` decorator. This means that we don’t need to download and load the model multiple times. This step will make your app feel much more responsive! \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional note: for further responsiveness, there’s [defer_loading](https://panel.holoviz.org/how_to/callbacks/load.html) and [loading indicators](https://panel.holoviz.org/how_to/param/examples/loading.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@pn.cache\n",
    "def load_processor_model(\n",
    "    processor_name: str, model_name: str\n",
    ") -> Tuple[CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel]:\n",
    "    processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(processor_name)\n",
    "    model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(model_name)\n",
    "    return processor, model\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bridging Functionality with JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "While Panel provides a rich set of interactive features, you may occasionally require additional functionality that can be achieved through JavaScript. It’s easy to integrate JavaScript code with Panel visualizations to extend their capabilities. By bridging the gap between Python and JavaScript, you can create advanced visualizations and add interactive elements that go beyond the scope of Panel's native functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of our app, you might have observed a collection of icons representing Panel’s social media accounts, including LinkedIn and Twitter. When you click on any of these icons, you will be automatically redirected to the respective social media profiles. This seamless click and redirect functionality is made possible through Panel’s JavaScript integration with the `js_on_click` method: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "footer_row = pn.Row(pn.Spacer(), align=\"center\")\n",
    "for icon, url in ICON_URLS.items():\n",
    "    href_button = pn.widgets.Button(icon=icon, width=35, height=35)\n",
    "    href_button.js_on_click(code=f\"window.open('{url}')\")\n",
    "    footer_row.append(href_button)\n",
    "footer_row.append(pn.Spacer())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Sync vs. Async Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming has gained popularity due to its ability to handle concurrent tasks efficiently. We'll discuss the differences between synchronous and asynchronous execution and explore Panel's support for asynchronous operations. Understanding these concepts will enable you to leverage async capabilities within Panel, providing enhanced performance and responsiveness in your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `async` to your function allows collaborative multitasking within a single thread and allows IO tasks to happen in the background. For example, when we fetch a random image to the internet, we don’t know how long we’d need to wait and we don’t want to stop our program while waiting. Async enables concurrent execution, allowing us to perform other tasks while waiting and ensuring a responsive application. Be sure to add the corresponding awaits too.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def open_image_url(image_url: str) -> Image:\n",
    "    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n",
    "        async with session.get(image_url) as resp:\n",
    "            return Image.open(io.BytesIO(await resp.read()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unfamiliar with async, it’s also possible to rewrite this in sync too! async is **not** a requirement of using Panel!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def open_image_url(image_url: str) -> Image:\n",
    "    with requests.get(image_url) as resp:\n",
    "        return Image.open(io.BytesIO(resp.read()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
