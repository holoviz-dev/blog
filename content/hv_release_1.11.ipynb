    "## Style mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major strengths of HoloViews has always been the ease with which an existing dataset be it an array, DataFrame or xarray object can we wrapped and visualized. However frequently the values in a dataset do not map straightforwardly onto a visual representation and various options proliferated that allowed controlling these mappings, e.g. to scale the size of a set of points three different options were involved (``size_index``, ``scaling_factor`` and ``scaling_method``). These ad-hoc implementations have now been replaced by a general API for declaring arbitrary mappings between your data and the visual attributes of your plot, which can be expressed using the new ``dim`` object:"

In this release we have tried to simplify the API for some of these more common operations."

    "#### Simplified options\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever since the first release of HoloViews we have heavily relied on the IPython magics to specify options. They provided a convenient, tab-completable and concise syntax for customizing plots in the notebook. At the same time however the custom syntax was often a bit jarring to new users and often made it difficult to move code between a notebook and a script. We therefore set out to replace the magics with something equally as convenient but relying only on pure Python syntax."

    "#### Simplified plot options\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common thing catching out new users has been the difficulty of expressing plot ranges, formatters, and axis labels using a completely declarative approach by defining these on the Dimension objects. Therefore we decided to finally add ``xlabel``/``ylabel``, ``xlim``/``ylim`` and ``xformatter``/``yformatter`` providing a more familiar API to fall back to during exploratory work, while still supporting the ``Dimension`` based declarative approach we recommend."

    "One of the major difficulties when using HoloViews was setting sufficient padding for a plot so data that was near the edge of a plot would not be cut off. Instead of manually setting axis ranges it is now possible to use the ``padding`` option to specify the fraction of the plot devoted that should be padded, either for both axes, for each axis individually or even for the upper and lower bound of each axis."
