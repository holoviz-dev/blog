    "The HoloViz [Examples website](https://examples.holoviz.org/) shows real-world workflows where HoloViz tools simplify and improve the exploration of data. However, the website had not been well maintained as it used legacy APIs and contained many issues that hindered the user experience. HoloViz was awarded a development grant from NumFOCUS to modernize and enhance these workflows. The goal was to improve the website by adopting existing APIs, streamlining the contributor guide, and adopting best practices in modern HoloViz applications.\n",

    "The foremost impact of this proposal was the revitalization of the examples website, transforming it into an even more robust and intuitive learning resource. This was completed with the help of two new contributors whose fresh perspectives helped identify issues and improve the onboarding process for other contributors. "

Beyond learning about HoloViz tools, I gained a deeper understanding of open source contributions, including the workflow intricacies. This includes creating pull requests when making new changes or opening a new issue to document bugs found in the examples. Neither of which I’ve used when developing my own projects. Setting up the environment was also a tricky process as I had to do it in WSL. This exposure to WSL has helped me when working with other projects that are required to be using Linux. \n",

    "Working on this project has not only been an enjoyable experience but also an incredibly educational one. The journey began with a steep learning curve, but overcoming those initial challenges has made the entire process more rewarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Panel and HoloViz Libraries\n",
    "The Panel and HoloViz libraries were at the core of our project. Panel, being a high-level app and dashboarding solution for Python, allowed us to create interactive visualizations effortlessly. HoloViz, with its suite of tools designed to work seamlessly together, made data visualization tasks more intuitive and efficient. These tools have significantly enhanced my ability to create compelling and interactive data visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datashader\n",
    "Modernizing examples using the Datashader library was one of the highlights of the project. Datashader excels at creating meaningful visualizations from large datasets, a critical capability in the age of big data. My extensive use of Datashader has turned it into a reliable tool that I now feel confident using for future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anaconda-Project\n",
    "Another crucial aspect of the project was mastering anaconda-project. It facilitated managing project dependencies and environments, ensuring that the project was reproducible at various levels. This experience underscored the [importance of reproducibility in data science](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/8-levels-of-reproducibility), which is vital for collaboration and long-term project sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overcoming Challenges\n",
    "The initial phase was riddled with challenges, particularly in setting up the project locally and navigating the submission process for Pull Requests. The support from the project leaders was invaluable. Their guidance helped streamline our workflow, making subsequent tasks more manageable and efficient. This collaborative effort not only improved my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of teamwork and effective communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Prospects\n",
    "This project has been a significant milestone in my career. Working with the HoloViz team has not only broadened my technical expertise but also inspired me to continue exploring and utilizing these tools. I am excited to integrate HoloViz and its associated libraries into my future personal and professional data science endeavors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has been an enriching experience, providing both challenges and opportunities for growth. The skills and knowledge gained will undoubtedly influence my future work, and I am grateful for the chance to contribute to such a dynamic and innovative project."
