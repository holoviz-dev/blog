    "The HoloViz [Examples website](https://examples.holoviz.org/) shows real-world workflows where HoloViz tools simplify and improve the exploration of data. However, the website had not been well maintained as it used legacy APIs and contained many issues that hindered the user experience. HoloViz was awarded a development grant from NumFOCUS to modernize and enhance these workflows. The goal was to improve the website by adopting existing APIs, streamlining the contributor guide, and adopting best practices in modern HoloViz applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foremost impact of this proposal was the revitalization of the examples website, transforming it into an even more robust and intuitive learning resource. This was completed with the help of two new contributors whose fresh perspectives helped identify issues and improve the onboarding process for other contributors. "
