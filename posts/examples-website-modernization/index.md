[HoloViz](https://holoviz.org){.external target="_blank"} is an ecosystem of open-source tools designed to make data visualization in Python both simpler and more powerful, featuring projects like [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org){.external target="_blank"}, [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org){.external target="_blank"}, [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org){.external target="_blank"}, and [Datashader](https://datashader.org){.external target="_blank"}. The individual galleries for these tools (such as the [Panel App Gallery](https://panel.holoviz.org/gallery/index.html){.external target="_blank"} or the [HoloViews Gallery](https://holoviews.org/gallery/index.html){.external target="_blank"}) primarily focus on demonstrating the specific capabilities and APIs of each package. In contrast, the [HoloViz Examples Gallery](https://examples.holoviz.org/){.external target="_blank"} takes a broader approach, showcasing over 40 **domain-specific narrative examples** that integrate multiple HoloViz tools. These examples are structured around real-world data stories, providing better context for both the analysis and the tools involved, while highlighting the power of cross-package workflows.

Beyond being a learning resource, the HoloViz Examples Gallery serves as an ideal onramp for new contributors to the ecosystem. It invites users to bring their domain expertise and create new examples that showcase their unique perspectives and use cases. With the combination of updated examples, contributor guides, and a streamlined process for adding new content, the gallery lowers barriers to entry for those interested in contributing to HoloViz, fostering a more diverse community. 

In this blog post, we‚Äôre excited to share significant improvements to the Examples Gallery, made possible by a [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org/){.external target="_blank"} small development grant.

This website presents some unique features:

- Each example is available for download as an `anaconda-project`[^1] zip file, enabling users to run any example with the correct dependencies and datasets on any platform. Learn more about the process [here](https://examples.holoviz.org/getting_started.html#run-locally){.external target="_blank"}.
- Most of the examples have either a read-only Notebook deployment ([try one!](https://world-cup-notebook.holoviz-demo.anaconda.com/notebooks/world_cup.ipynb){.external target="_blank"}) or a fully interactive Panel app deployment ([try one!](https://world-cup.holoviz-demo.anaconda.com/){.external target="_blank"}). These deployments allow users to explore plots and apps interactively, even when full interactivity isn‚Äôt available on the static Examples website. Thanks to [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/){.external target="_blank"} for providing us with this platform üôè.

Maintaining a large collection of complex data visualization projects is challenging for an open-source team. Over time, the gallery's content, infrastructure, and design became outdated, with many examples depending on tools and APIs no longer aligned with best practices. While infrastructure updates were manageable, refreshing the content proved far more difficult. To address this, we applied for a [NumFocus Small Development Grant](https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants){.external target="_blank"} in late 2022, aiming to modernize the gallery and onboard new contributors.

With the $10,000 grant awarded in early 2023, two new contributors, [Isaiah](https://github.com/azaya89){.external target="_blank"} and [Jason](https://github.com/jtao1){.external target="_blank"}, joined the project. Together, they worked toward the following goals:

- Update high-priority examples to reflect current best practices
- Improve and clarify guidelines for new contributors
- Organize examples into categories to enhance website navigation
- Add new examples to address underrepresented domains

With the help of a [comprehensive checklist](https://github.com/holoviz-topics/examples/wiki/Example-Modernization-Checklist-(2024)){.external target="_blank"}, Jason and Isaiah, guided primarily by Demetris and Maxime with additional feedback from the HoloViz team, worked on updating the examples and successfully delivered [15 modernized examples](https://github.com/holoviz-topics/examples/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3A%22NF+SDG%22+){.external target="_blank"}. Their work spanned many areas, including restructuring examples, enhancing UI, updating dependencies, and adopting modern APIs. While their contributions are too extensive to cover fully in this post, we‚Äôll focus on the improvements to API usage in the next section.

## Modernization: APIs

### [Plotting API: Prioritize hvPlot over HoloViews](https://holoviz.org/learn/background.html){.external target="_blank"}

Many examples were created before hvPlot was available or mature enough to use. hvPlot offers a simple, Pandas- and Xarray-friendly interface while exposing many capabilities offered by other HoloViz tools. In many cases, we replaced HoloViews code with hvPlot for its accessibility and ease of use. However, hvPlot isn‚Äôt a universal replacement‚Äîfeatures like complex interactivity (e.g., linked selections, streams) are still exclusive to HoloViews.

For instance, the [NYC Taxi example](https://examples.holoviz.org/gallery/nyc_taxi/index.html){.external target="_blank"} creates a scatter plot to see the relationship between distance and fare cost. The modernized version uses hvPlot for clarity and simplicity.

**Original code:**
```python
scatter = hv.Scatter(samples, 'trip_distance', 'fare_amount')
labelled = scatter.redim.label(trip_distance="Distance, miles", fare_amount="Fare, $") 
labelled.redim.range(trip_distance=(0, 20), fare_amount=(0, 40)).opts(size=5)
```

**Modernized code:**
```python
samples.hvplot.scatter(
    'trip_distance', 'fare_amount', xlabel='Distance, miles',
    ylabel='Fare, $', xlim=(0, 20), ylim=(0, 40), s=5,
)
```

### Large Data Rendering: Prioritize `rasterize` over `datashade` for Bokeh Plots

`rasterize` and `datashade` are HoloViews operations powered by Datashader, designed to handle large datasets by transforming elements into images where each pixel represents an aggregate of the underlying data. While both are essential for visualizing large data, they differ in functionality and use cases.

- `datashade`: Produces an RGB image that is sent directly to the front-end (browser) and displayed as is. This approach offers fast rendering but limits interactivity, such as hover tooltips or color bars, because the raw data is not available to the plotting library.
- `rasterize`: Generates a multidimensional array of aggregated data, which is sent to the front-end for further processing, such as applying colormaps. Although this requires more work from Bokeh, it allows for richer interactivity, including hover information and client-side color bars.

Due to these advantages, `rasterize` is now the recommended choice for most large dataset visualizations. Ongoing development continues to expand its capabilities and improve its integration across the HoloViz stack when using Bokeh as the plotting backend.

For example, the [NYC Taxi example](https://examples.holoviz.org/gallery/nyc_taxi/nyc_taxi.html#million-point-datashaded-plots-interactive){.external target="_blank"} demonstrates how `rasterize` can render 10 million data points interactively. The plot shows drop-off locations, with passenger counts aggregated per pixel and displayed on hover.

**Modernized code:**
```python
df.hvplot.points(
    'dropoff_x', 'dropoff_y', rasterize=True, dynspread=True,
    aggregator=ds.sum('passenger_count'), cnorm='eq_hist', cmap=cc.fire[100:],
    xaxis=None, yaxis=None, width=900, height=500, bgcolor='black',
)
```

### [Interactivity API: Prioritize pn.bind()](https://panel.holoviz.org/tutorials/basic/pn_bind.html){.external target="_blank"}

Over the years, Panel has introduced [multiple iteractive APIs](https://panel.holoviz.org/explanation/index.html#apis){.external target="_blank"}, and choosing the right one can be challenging. As the package has matured and user-feedback incorporated, `pn.bind()` has become the preferred option for linking widgets to functions while offering flexibility and a cleaner syntax over `pn.interact()` (deprecated), `@pn.depends()`, or `.param.watch()` for most use cases.

Importantly, exceptions remain, such as the recommendation to use `@param.depends()` to decorate methods for applications built with `param.Parameterized` classes, or using `.param.watch()` for more fine-grained control. Additionally, the [Portfolio Optimizer example](https://examples.holoviz.org/gallery/portfolio_optimizer/portfolio_optimizer.html#all-optimal-portfolios-efficient-frontier){.external target="_blank"} demonstrates the use of the new [reactive expression API (`.rx`)](https://panel.holoviz.org/tutorials/basic/pn_rx.html){.external target="_blank"}, which extends `pn.bind()` and the deprecated `pn.interact()` for reactive programming. This experimental `.rx` API is a promising addition, and we encourage users to explore it and share feedback.

In the [Attractors example](https://examples.holoviz.org/gallery/attractors/clifford_panel.html){.external target="_blank"}, we updated the code by replacing the deprecated `pn.interact()` with `pn.bind()`. This modernized approach explicitly links widgets to a function that plots an attractor using Datashader.


Original code:
```python
pn.interact(clifford_plot, n=(1,20000000), colormap=ps)
```

Modernized code: 
```python
widgets = {
    'a': pn.widgets.FloatSlider(value=1.9, end=2.0, step=0.1, name='a'),
    'b': pn.widgets.FloatSlider(value=1.9, end=2.0, step=0.1, name='b'),
    'c': pn.widgets.FloatSlider(value=1.9, end=2.0, step=0.1, name='c'),
    'd': pn.widgets.FloatSlider(value=0.8, end=1.0, step=0.1, name='d'),
    'n': pn.widgets.IntSlider(value=10000000, start=1000, end=20000000, step=100, name='n'),
    'colormap': pn.widgets.Select(value=ps['bmw'], options=ps, name='colormap'),
}

bound_clifford_plot = pn.bind(clifford_plot, **widgets)
pn.Column(*widgets.values(), bound_clifford_plot)
```

## Improved contributor guide

To support the modernization efforts and encourage new contributions, the contributor guide was updated to reflect the changes in infrastructure. The guide now provides clearer instructions and step-by-step guidance for new users to create and contribute examples to the gallery.

To make the process even more accessible, Isaiah created a detailed video tutorial that walks through each step of contributing a new example.

## Reflections

### [Jason‚Äôs](https://github.com/jtao1){.external target="_blank"} Reflections

Contributing to the revitalization of the examples website was an enlightening experience for me. Beyond learning about HoloViz tools, I gained a deeper understanding of open source contributions, including the workflow intricacies. This includes creating pull requests when making new changes or opening a new issue to document bugs found in the examples. Neither of which I‚Äôve used when developing my own projects. Setting up the environment was also a tricky process as I had to do it in WSL. This exposure to WSL has helped me when working with other projects that are required to be using Linux. 

Overall, I am thankful to have been given this experience as a contributor as I‚Äôve acquired a fundamental understanding of the tools that could be used.

As early-career developers, they took on a complex task‚Äîworking with HoloViz‚Äôs expansive ecosystem‚Äîand did a great job making meaningful contributions. It‚Äôs not easy to navigate so many tools, APIs, and evolving documentation, but they approached the challenge with curiosity and determination.

Along the way, they helped us identify gaps in our APIs and brought fresh perspectives to our discussions about user experience. Their insights sparked conversations that led to improvements not just in the examples, but across HoloViz tools. We also appreciated their patience and adaptability as we all worked together to smooth out the edges of our first project funded by a NumFocus grant.

This collaboration wasn‚Äôt just about the examples‚Äîthey‚Äôve made lasting contributions to the ecosystem and the community. We‚Äôre excited to see where their journeys take them next. Jason and Isaiah, thank you for your hard work!

[^1]: `anaconda-project` is a project management tool created in 2016 and that predates most (if not all!) of the tools of this type like Poetry, Hatch, PDM,  Pixi, conda-project, etc. It is no longer maintained and we do not recommend adopting it, some day we'll migrate to another tool.
