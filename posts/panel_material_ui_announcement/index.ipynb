    "## Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been building [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org) for almost 7 years now. Today, it powers dashboards, AI workflows, and data applications across research and industry, with over **1.2 million downloads per month**. At the same time one piece of feedback we've gotten over and over was that it was **too hard to style Panel components**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we set out to build a **comprehensive, consistent, and API compatible set of components**, replacing the existing Panel implementations. We wanted to make sure we maintained compatibility with existing Panel components while exposing as many MUI components as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why [MUI]((https://mui.com/)) in particular, you might ask? We wanted to build on a library that has:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Maturity**: MUI is one of the most widely used React component libraries, with strong community support and robust documentation.\n",
    "* **Consistent Design**: It implements Google’s Material Design system, providing a polished and consistent user experience out of the box.\n",
    "* **Customizable and themeable**: MUI has a well-designed theming system that maps cleanly to how we wanted to style Panel apps.\n",
    "* **Strong accessibility support**: MUI handles many of the hard parts of accessibility for us, giving us a more solid foundation.\n",
    "* **Component breadth**: It includes a wide range of components — from simple buttons to complex layout and navigation elements — that we can gradually wrap and expose in Panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for our (and your) sanity we also wanted a library that would make it **easy to create new components**. The tight React implementation just made it a joy to build, particularly with AI assistance. This also means creating custom components building on `panel-material-ui` is a breeze."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## How?\n",
    "\n",
    "With the addition of [ESM components](https://panel.holoviz.org/how_to/custom_components/index.html#esm-components), it has finally become straightforward to build custom Panel components. Building on the [React integration](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/custom_components/ReactComponent.html), I quickly discovered that mapping parameters in Python to React state was a simple problem where LLMs could provide significant assistance. Using a simple prompt, I was able to bootstrap a comprehensive set of components and their respective React implementations. That said, I've always been skeptical of fully auto-generated component wrappers. While promising in theory, the UX of a purely automated wrapper library inevitably suffers, and the initial AI-generated component set was no exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the basic structure was in place, we methodically reviewed, cleaned up, and documented each component in detail. At this point, I'd like to extend special thanks to [Thuy Do](https://github.com/thuydotm) and [Marc Skov Madsen](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen) for their invaluable contributions in writing tests, creating documentation, and providing feedback throughout the process."

    "### Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we mentioned that `panel-material-ui` has full compatibility with Panel, but what does that actually mean? The goal from the very beginning was to provide a set of components that could be drop-in replacements for existing Panel components, this means that you should be able to change the imports and with a few minor exceptions the `panel-material-ui` component should behave just like the original Panel one. The idea being that the transition to panel-material-ui should be as easy as possible and that when we eventually replace the original Panel components as part of the Panel 2.0 release, there will not be a major transition either. Compatibility also means you can mix-and-match regular `panel` and `panel-material-ui` components as you see fit."

    "\n",
    "In the past Panel had introduced a so called `Design`. We build on that here but for the most part only use that system to ensure that the theme defined in `panel-material-ui` flows down to standard Panel components. Let's briefly define our technology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Design**: The overall set of CSS stylesheets, component defaults that align an application with a particular design system.\n",
    "- **Theme**: A theme in Panel defines the configuration of default color settings in both light (default) and dark mode.\n",
    "- **Styling**: Applying one-off modications to a specific components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `panel-material-ui` the main entrypoint for theming that you need to care about is the [`theme_config` parameter](https://panel-material-ui.holoviz.org/customization/customize.html#theming), present on all Material components. It makes it easy to configure the default colors, typography and more, either globally or differentially for dark and light themes. Thanks to inheritance the `theme_config` can be applied on a parent component and will flow down to all its children:"
