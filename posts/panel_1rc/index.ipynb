    "We are thrilled to announce the availability of the Panel 1.0 release candidate for general testing! We want to extend our thanks for your patience as we've been working tirelessly to adapt to major changes in Bokeh 3.x, improving the API and polishing our user experience. This significant undertaking has paved the way for a new, performant layout engine and greater customizability by exposing CSS stylesheets APIs directly in Python. We believe this release represents a major step forward in customizability, performance, and usability. \n",
    "\n",
    "We kindly ask for your help in testing the Panel 1.0 release candidate. The bottom up rewrite of the layout engine and component rendering may cause some disruption in the short term so we wanted to get these changes in your hands to gather feedback before the full release. To get the RC release today use:\n",

    "- Much, much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also still a few items left items we hope to wrap up before the final release:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are still working on fully supporting `ipywidgets` rendering\n",
